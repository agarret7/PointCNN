# PointCNN
PyTorch implementation of PointCNN model specified in the white paper located here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07791.pdf

Current MNIST accuracy: ~96%

My coding style is somewhat unique, but ultimately geared towards maximal
readability. Along with extensive documentation in the code, I use type , and
code comments indicating input/outputs shapes.  (x,y,z) just indicate that any
value is accepted at runtime.
